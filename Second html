Certainly! To create an HTML file for a second page on a GitHub website, follow these steps:

1. Open your code editor and create a new file named `index.html`.
2. Add the basic HTML structure:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Your Second Page</title>
</head>
<body>

<!-- Your content goes here -->

</body>
</html>
```

3. Customize the content inside the `<body>` tag based on what you want to display on the second page.

4. Save the file.

5. Upload the `index.html` file to the desired location in your GitHub repository.

6. Ensure that your repository is configured to serve GitHub Pages. You can set this up in the repository settings under the "Pages" section.

After these steps, your second page should be accessible on your GitHub Pages site using the URL `https://username.github.io/repository-name/` (replace "username" with your GitHub username and "repository-name" with the name of your repository).

Remember to commit and push your changes to GitHub after creating the new HTML file.
